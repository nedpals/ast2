# ast2

ast2 is a rewrite of some of V's [compiler modules](https://github.com/vlang/v/tree/master/vlib/v) (parser, checker, and etc.). It aims to simplify both in terms of the codebase and the architecture (in a way) and to further improve the developer experience and maximize its use for third-party tools outside the V compiler.
